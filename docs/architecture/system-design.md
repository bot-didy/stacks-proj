# System Design

## üèóÔ∏è Overall Architecture

The marketplace is designed as a modular, upgradeable system with clear separation of concerns.

### Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Each contract handles specific functionality
- **Upgradability**: Critical components can be upgraded without migration
- **Security**: Defense in depth with multiple security layers
- **Gas Efficiency**: Optimized for minimal transaction costs
- **User Experience**: Simple interfaces for complex operations

## üîÑ Data Flow

### Marketplace Listing Flow

1. NFT owner approves marketplace contract
2. Owner calls `listItem()` with price and terms
3. Listing data stored in marketplace state
4. Event emitted for indexing

### Purchase Flow

1. Buyer calls `buyItem()` with ETH payment
2. Contract validates listing and payment
3. Royalties calculated and distributed
4. Platform fees deducted
5. NFT transferred to buyer
6. Remaining ETH sent to seller

## üóÉÔ∏è Storage Design

### State Management

- Listings stored in mapping by token ID
- User balances tracked separately
- Royalty data cached for gas efficiency

### Event System

- Comprehensive event logging for all operations
- Indexed parameters for efficient querying
- Off-chain indexing support

## üîê Security Model

### Access Control Layers

1. **Contract Level**: Role-based permissions
2. **Function Level**: Modifier-based guards
3. **Data Level**: Input validation and sanitization

### Emergency Controls

- Pausable functionality for all operations
- Emergency withdrawal mechanisms
- Timelock for critical upgrades

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

### Gas Optimization Strategies

- Packed structs for storage efficiency
- Batch operations for multiple items
- Assembly code for critical paths
- Storage slot optimization

### Scalability Considerations

- Off-chain metadata storage
- Event-based state synchronization
- Lazy loading of non-critical data

# Security Features

## 🛡️ Security Overview

Our marketplace implements multiple security layers to protect users and assets.

### Core Security Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Fail Secure**: Safe defaults in error conditions
- **Transparency**: Open source and auditable code

## 🔒 Access Control

### Role-Based Permissions

- **Admin**: Contract upgrades and emergency functions
- **Operator**: Day-to-day operations and maintenance
- **User**: Basic marketplace interactions

### Permission Management

```solidity
modifier onlyAdmin() {
    require(hasRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender), "Admin required");
    _;
}

modifier onlyOperator() {
    require(hasRole(OPERATOR_ROLE, msg.sender), "Operator required");
    _;
}
```

## 🚫 Attack Prevention

### Reentrancy Protection

- OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- State changes before external calls

### Integer Overflow/Underflow

- Solidity 0.8+ built-in protection
- SafeMath for additional operations
- Explicit bounds checking

### Front-Running Mitigation

- Commit-reveal schemes for sensitive operations
- Time-based delays for critical functions
- MEV-resistant design patterns

## ⏸️ Emergency Controls

### Pause Functionality

```solidity
function pause() external onlyAdmin {
    _pause();
}

function unpause() external onlyAdmin {
    _unpause();
}
```

### Emergency Withdrawal

- Admin can pause and withdraw funds in emergency
- User funds protected with timelocks
- Multi-signature requirements for large operations

## 🔍 Audit Trail

### Comprehensive Logging

- All state changes logged via events
- User actions tracked and indexed
- Financial transactions fully auditable

### Monitoring and Alerting

- Real-time transaction monitoring
- Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
- Automated security alerts

## 🧪 Testing and Verification

### Security Testing

- Static analysis with Slither
- Formal verification for critical functions
- Fuzzing for edge case discovery
- Gas limit attack testing

### Audit Process

- Professional security audits
- Community review periods
- Bug bounty programs
- Continuous monitoring
